    <p><em>Simple</em> property beeds are {@link org.beedra_II.property.PropertyBeed property beeds}
      that are state holders for a simple value or reference. Simple property beeds hold
      one date, or one number, or one object reference.</p>
    <p>Classes and interfaces in this package should be considered mainly an implementation
      help for beed developers (notably beed developers for custom value types). The fact that
      a property beed value or reference is <em>simple</em> has no semantic bearing whatsoever.
      Often, property beeds of a simple type are yet defined without reference to
      {@link SimplePropertyBeed}, e.g., the number beeds ({@see org.beedra_II.property.double.DoubleBeed}),
      which are not <em>simple</em> because of inheritance needs.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, peripheral developers can exploit common code for {@link SimplePropertyBeed}
      subtypes, so beeds for which it is appropriate, should be developed as a subtype of
      {@link SimplePropertyType} as much as possible.</p>
    <p>The events send by simple property beeds are often {@link OldNewEvent OldNewEvents}, that express
      the change by offering the new and the old value of the changed beed. Yet, also non-simple property
      beeds, or non-property beeds, could send {@link OldNewEvent OldNewEvents}, and not all subtypes of
      {@link SimplePropertyBeed} send {@link OldNewEvent OldNewEvents} (see, e.g., {@link SetBeed}).</p>
