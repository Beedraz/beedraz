  <p class="lead">The
    <a href="./"><kbd class="fileName">logo</kbd></a>
    directory contains the Beedraz logo in different formats. This logo was created
    by Jan Dockx, as sole author.</p>
  <p>The logo was created originally in <a href="http://www.deneba.com/" target="extern">Deneba
    Canvas 7</a> on a Macintosh (<kbd class="fileName">*.CNV</kbd>). All other files
    are derived from that original.</p>
  <h1>Use</h1>
  <p class="DEVELOPMENT-NOTE">The intention is to use higher quality JPEG files
    throughout the site, and not GIF files (barring evolutions in the patent world).
    However, I do not seem to be able to make a JPEG transparent, so in the cases
    were transparency is desirable, we use GIF instead.</p>
